== Homepage

https://ODU-CGA-CubeSat.github.io/sealion-mission-architecture

== Design Philosophy

The {presentation_title} follows a https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[docs-as-code] & https://www.writethedocs.org/videos/portland/2019/lessons-learned-in-a-year-of-docs-driven-development-jessica-parsons/[docs-driven development] approach, as to ensure:

* Documentation and development are tightly coupled.
* No requirement or feature goes undocumented.

== Stakeholder Needs
 
The {presentation_title} is guided by a series of stakeholder needs...
